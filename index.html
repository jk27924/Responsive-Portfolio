            <p>I'm a Human Resources manager in an Software Engineering company from Austin, TX.</p>

            <p>I enjoy taking complicated tasks in fast-paced environment, and changing them to simple and organized results. I also love helping employees who are having difficulties in terms of relationship between others in the company and their personal lives as well by listening, investigating, and planning.</p>
      
            <p>I recently resigned from my job, and studying coding that I'm crazily in love with now. I am learning HTML and CSS, and about to jump into more complex and exciting coding world.</p>
